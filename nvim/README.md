# There are many stages to build a Great nvim config:
- [X]  Vim Options (default options that set common stuff)
- [X]  Key Mappings ( this will incrementally change according to plugins used and configured)
- [X]  Plugin Manager ( Got the lazy up and running)
- [X]  Git signs and Git integrations ( I have done this half and the other complicated part is remaining although its necessary to have good git integrations I just gonna avoid that for now)
 - [X]  Lsp configurations ( This was tedious task for sure and thanks to the LLMs that are super Coherent and precise)
    - Still there is alot of things I don't really know about and alot of things that in my config still makes less sense due to incomplete knowledge.
 - [X]  Auto Complete ( This was also hard but not that much and I need to know how everything is connected and works seamlessly)
- [ ] Ai Stuff
- [ ] Markdown and note-taking
- [ ] Debugger
- The things I have noticed that startup time is gone up by alot and that's obvious at this point with alot of plugins running. I have to decide what to lazy load.
## Miscellanous stuff remaining like 
Some good plugins which greatly improves exp.
And Terminal and test plugins for easy testing.
I will try to write the assignment of this semester here will see how it goes as I already have most of things configured and ready to roll.
