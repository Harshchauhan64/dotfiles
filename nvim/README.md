# There are many stages to build a Great nvim config:
- [X]  Vim Options (default options that set common stuff)
- [X]  Key Mappings ( this will incrementally change according to plugins used and configured)
- [X]  Plugin Manager ( Got the lazy up and running)
- [X]  Git signs and Git integrations ( I have done this half and the other complicated part is remaining although its necessary to have good git integrations I just gonna avoid that for now)
 - [X]  Lsp configurations ( This was tedious task for sure and thanks to the LLMs that are super Coherent and precise)
    - Still there is alot of things I don't really know about and alot of things that in my config still makes less sense due to incomplete knowledge.
 - [X]  Auto Complete ( This was also hard but not that much and I need to know how everything is connected and works seamlessly)
- [ ] Ai Stuff ( there is no need of this for now.)
- [X] Markdown and note-taking(holy grail of note-taking in nvim with obsidian doesn't exist there are alot of limitations)
- [ ] Debugger
- [x] Lazy Loading for better startup time.
## TODO: 
- read about Ex-colors plugin for efficient color_scheme.
- read bunch of docs to get good with the nvim because KNOW YOUR TOOLS.
